# Unrestricted Nephele Authenticator

A Nephele authenticator that allows **unrestricted access** to all users.

# Installation

```sh
npm i -s @nephele/authenticator-none
```

# Security Implications

If you use this authenticator, anyone who can reach your server on the network will have full access to create, read, update, and delete all resources controlled by this authenticator!

# Usage

The default export is the authenticator, and it's also a named export "Authenticator". Instantiate this class, and give that to Nephele as the authenticator.

```js
import express from 'express';
import nepheleServer from 'nephele';
import ExampleAdapter from '@nephele/adapter-example';
import InsecureAuthenticator from '@nephele/authenticator-none';

const app = express();
const port = 8080;

app.use(
  '/',
  nepheleServer({
    adapter: new ExampleAdapter(),
    authenticator: new InsecureAuthenticator(),
  }),
);

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Nephele WebDAV server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```
