# PAM Nephele Authenticator

A Nephele authenticator that uses PAM (system users) as its authentication backend.

# Installation

Follow these steps to install PAM development libraries for your OS:

```sh
# Centos and RHEL:
sudo yum install pam-devel

# Debian/Ubuntu:
sudo apt install libpam0g-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf install pam-devel

# Arch and macOS: already installed
```

(Source: https://www.npmjs.com/package/authenticate-pam#Install)

Then,

```sh
npm i -s @nephele/authenticator-pam
```

# Usage

The default export is the authenticator, and it's also a named export "Authenticator". Instantiate this class, providing an options object if needed, and give that to Nephele as the authenticator.

```js
import express from 'express';
import nepheleServer from 'nephele';
import ExampleAdapter from '@nephele/adapter-example';
import PamAuthenticator from '@nephele/authenticator-pam';

const app = express();
const port = 8080;

app.use(
  '/',
  nepheleServer({
    adapter: new ExampleAdapter(),
    authenticator: new PamAuthenticator({
      realm: 'My WebDAV Server',
    }),
  }),
);

app.listen(port, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log(`Nephele WebDAV server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

# Requirements

Read the details on https://www.npmjs.com/package/authenticate-pam, which is used for the actual PAM authentication.

# Options / Defaults

- `realm` = `'Nephele WebDAV Service'`: The realm is the name reported by the server when the user is prompted to authenticate.
- `unauthorizedAccess` = `false`: Allow the user to proceed, even if they are not authenticated.
- `allowedUIDs` = `'500-59999'`: Comma separated UID ranges that are allowed to log in.

## realm

It should be HTTP header safe (shouldn't include double quotes or semicolon).

## unauthorizedAccess

The authenticator will advertise that authentication is available, but the user will have access to the server without providing authentication.

In the unauthorized state, the `user` presented to the Nephele adapter will have the username "nobody".

WARNING: It is very dangerous to allow unauthorized access if write actions are allowed!

## allowedUIDs

You can set, for example, "0,1000-1999" to allow the first 1000 normal users and root to log in.

Root is always UID 0. On most systems, daemon users are assigned UIDs in the range 2-999, normal users are assigned UIDs in the range 1000-65533, and the "nobody" user is assigned UID 65534. On some systems (including macOS), normal users are assigned IDs starting at 500, which is why the default includes this range.
